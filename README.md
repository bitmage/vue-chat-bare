# Vue Bare

A chat demo using Vue.  No build tools, just raw JS.  Server communication is mocked out in `js/chatApi.js`... Replace with Ajax calls to connect the chat to a real server.

# Running

Just serve the project directory.  You can use `node-static`:

```bash
npm install -g node-static
static .
```
